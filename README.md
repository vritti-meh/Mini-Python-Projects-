Project 1 - **Taking screenshots using pyscreenshots in Python**
---
Python provides a module called pyscreenshot for this task. It is only a pure Python wrapper, a thin layer over existing backends. Performance and interactivity are not important for this library. `show()` function is used to view the screenshot and `grab()` function is used to capture the screenshot.
