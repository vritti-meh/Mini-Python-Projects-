# Mini-Python-Projects
Project 1 - **Taking screenshots using pyscreenshots in Python**
---
Python provides a module called pyscreenshot for this task. It is only a pure Python wrapper, a thin layer over existing backends. Performance and interactivity are not important for this library. `show()` function is used to view the screenshot and `grab()` function is used to capture the screenshot.

Project 2 - **Generate QR Code using pyqrcode module**
---
`pyqrcode` module is a QR code generator. The module automates most of the building process for creating QR codes. This module attempts to follow the QR code standard as closely as possible. The terminology and the encodings used in pyqrcode come directly from the standard.
